CLOUD BASED VEDIO STREAMING APPLICATION 


INTRODUCTION TO VIDEO STREAMING 

video streaming is the delivery of video content over the internet allowing users to view video in real time without downloading them 

IMPORTANCE OF CLOUD COMPUTING 
. The cloud offers scalability, reliability and on demand resources management for video streaming application 

INTERNSHIP OVERVIEW 
. Role focused on backend and API development 
. Contribution to designing and developing the infrastructure behind video streaming services 

TECHNOLOGIES USED 
. Backend development,APIs integration, cloud based services 


WHAT IS CLOUD BASED STREAMING 

DEFINITION:
A cloud based video streaming services delivers video content through the internet, using cloud resource to store and distribute content. 

BENEFITS:
SCALABILITY: Resources scale according to user demand. 
ACCESSIBILITY: Available on any device connected to the internet.
RELIABILITY: Content is served from globally distributed servers,ensuring high uptime. 
POPULAR EXAMPLES:
NETFLIX, YOUTUBE,HULU, AMAZON PRIME VIDEO 

KEY COMPONENTS OF A VIDEO STREAMING APPLICATION 

FRONTEND:
.User interface for video playback, search, recommendations, and interaction.
platforms like web apps, mobile apps, and smart Tvs.

BACKEND:
.Server side infrastructure that handles data processing, user management, and content storage.

APIs:
. Provide communication between the frontend and backend services (user authentication, video data).


TECHNOLOGIES USED IN CLOUD BASED VEDIO STREAMING 

CLOUD PLATFORM:
AWS ( AMAZON WEB SERVICES), GOOGLE CLOUD, MICROSOFT AZURE.

BACKEND LANGUAGES:
Node.js, Python, Java.
APIS:
RESTFUL APIs,Graph QL.

DATABASE:
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra for scalable data storage 
SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL for relational data storage.

VIDEO TRANSCODING:
. FFmpeg for transcoding video into different formats for adaptive streaming 
.AWS elemental media convert for high quality transcoding.
CDN:
Amazon cloud front, Akamai for fast global content delivery.

BACKEND ARCHITECTURE FOR VIDEO STREAMING 
MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE:
. Backend is divided into small, independent services for better maintainability.
.separate services for video management, user profiles, playback control.

APIs:
. Authentication APIs:Manages user authentication (JWT,OAuth).
. VIDEO MANAGEMENT API: Handles video upload,metadata,and categorisation.
. STREAMING API: Delivers video content based on user request using HLS
(HTTP live streaming)or 
DASH(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

DATABASE MANAGEMENT:
.Stores video metadata,user profiles, and video statistics.
MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage 

API DEVELOPMENT FOR VIDEO STREAMING 

ROLE OF APIs:
AUTHENTICATION API: Handles user registration,login,and token management.
VIDEO UPLOAD API:Manages video metadata, categorisation,and storage location. 
STREAMING API: Request video chunks from the cloud and delivers them to the client in real -time.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
. Efficient data transfer to reduce latency and improve user experience.
. Securing APIs to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive user data.
. Scalability to handle a large number of requests per second.
TECH STACK:
. Express.js for API server.
. MongoDB for storing video metadata.
.JWT for secure token-based authentication.

CHALLENGES IN BACKEND/API DEVELOPMENT:
SCALABILITY:
.Handling millions of concurrent users, especially during peak times.
LATENCY:
.Minimising video buffering to provide smooth playback.
SECURITY:
.Ensuring content is protected from privacy,user data is encrypted.
API RATE LIMITING:
.Preventing overload and ensuring that APIs function without delay.
INTEGRATION:
. Ensuring that APIs work smoothly across multiple devices and platforms.
( IOS, Android,Web).

SOLUTIONS & BEST PRACTICES:
.LAOD BALANCING:
Distributed traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.
.CDN INTEGRATION:
Use cloud front, Akamai,or similar services to distribute video content globally, reducing latency.
. CACHING:
Implement caching strategies at various level (API,CDN)to minimize database load and reduce latency.
.API OPTIMIZATION:
Use asynchronous APIs and pagination to manage large datasets and reduce client side wait times.
.SECURITY MEASURES:
HTTPs for secure communication.
OAuth and JWT for secure authentication.
Encryption of sensitive data.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE PROSPECTS:

SUMMARY:
.Key takeaway : The cloud and APIs play a critical role in making video streaming scalable and efficient.
 Future trends:
.AI/ML Integration: Personalized recommendations, content prediction.
.Video compression:New codecs for higher quality and faster streaming.
.Edge computing: Placing resources closer to user for reduced latency.
